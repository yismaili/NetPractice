# NetPractice
This project is a general practical exercise to let you discover networking.

# History of Networking
omputer networking as we know it today may be said to have gotten its start with the Arpanet development in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Prior to that time there were computer vendor “networks” designed primarily to connect terminals and remote job entry stations to a mainframe.

# What is Networking
 A network consists of two or more computers that are linked in order to share resources (such as printers and CDs), exchange files, or allow electronic communications. The computers on a network may be linked through cables, telephone lines, radio waves, satellites, or infrared light beams.
